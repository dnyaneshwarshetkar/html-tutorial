    - What is the HTML DOM?
        The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

        The HTML elements as objects
        The properties of all HTML elements
        The methods to access all HTML elements
        The events for all HTML elements
        In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
